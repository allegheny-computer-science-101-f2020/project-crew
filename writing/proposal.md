# Useful Tool for Spies

## Kevin Lee, Adriana Solis, Gabe Schwartz

## Description of the Main Idea

The idea of this project is to form a program that will be able to encrypt a string of text that is inputted then decrypt it. The encryption of the string of text will be unreadable and unrecognizable to people that try to read it. Additionally, this program will also offer the capabilities to decrypt the messages inputted into this program that became encrypted. Therefore, this program will be a useful tool for people that are trying to send secret messages.

For example, this program can make an encryption key program that accepts messages from a user, encrypts it, then decrypts it using a cipher. This process means that the main component of the process of encryption and decrypting comes from the use of a cipher. The program will encrypt the message then print out a cipher, decrypt the cipher, then print out the message that was encrypted decrypted.


## Description of the Tasks that You Will Complete

The task we will complete will be to accept a string of text that we will then encrypt and turn into a cypher. Once the text has been encrypted and turned into a cypher we will then take that cypher and decrypt it back into a readable string. This will be done by using a scanner to scan the inputted string into the code. Once the message has been inputted into the code using the scanner we will then use a hex string to create a cypher. We will then store the cypher and run it back through a hex string in order to get the message back. We will also use a key generator in order to add another layer of security and allow each of us to encrypt and decrypt messages across computers. We will also implement doubling experiments in order to evaluate the efficiency of the code.

## Detailed Plan for Your Team to Complete the Project

In order to make sure that everyone understands what the project will do, and also has the chance to add in code, we will split up the code into 4 java files separate from the main java file. This allows all of the team members to put in the same amount of effort and helps to ensure the least amount of mistakes. Every team member will help with the java file that conducts the doubling experiment as well as the file that contains the main method, and they will also be in charge of their own file that implements some part of the cryptography methods. In order to make sure that this project is completed by the given due dates, we will meet twice a week over a discord server to work on the code. We will also utilize the Technical Leaders as needed for any difficulties we encounter with the code in order to make sure that the code walk-through goes well. Every team member will assist with the writing requirements for this project in order to demonstrate the collective effort that will be taking place.
