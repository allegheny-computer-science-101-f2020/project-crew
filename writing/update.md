## Description of the work already completed

Our proposal has described the type of project our group desired to commit too. The project, we thought would be really cool to develop, consisted of working with a cipher. Therefore, we have been following the plan we proposed in the proposal.
Throughout the last few weeks we have been making a lot of progress and are practically done with our coding. We were able to reach this milestone by doing a lot of research the first few days. Then we continued to meet over discord and talked about ways to get our code done. The amount of work we have completed to this date include coding 2/3 of the ciphers we want, hard coding the println and system input statements, and implementing a Test case.

## Description of the steps that you will take to finish the project
We will continue this project by making sure our repository continues to run correctly, fix any build issues, code our last cipher, and include it in the hard coding for our print and system input coding. There is not much work left to be done and we are proud about the progress we have made.
